# PyTorch-Deep-Learning-Minicourse
Minicourse in Deep Learning with PyTorch

## Table of contents
`T`: theory
`P`: practice

 1. `T` Learning paradigms: supervised-, unsupervised-, and reinforcement-learning
 2. `P` Getting started with the tools: Jupyter notebook, PyTorch tensors and autodifferentiation
 3. `T+P` Supervised learning: regression and classification
 4. `T+P` Neural net's forward and backward propagation
 5. `T+P` Convolutional, spectral, recurrent, and graph neural nets improve performance by exploiting data nature
 6. `T+P` Unsupervised learning: vanilla and variational autoencoders, generative adversarial nets
