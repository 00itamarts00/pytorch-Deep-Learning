    "# An example of many-to-one (sequence classification)\n",
    "\n",
    "Original experiment from [Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997)](www.bioinf.jku.at/publications/older/2604.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to classify sequences.  \n",
    "Elements and targets are represented locally (input vectors with only one non-zero bit).  \n",
    "The sequence starts with an `B`, ends with a `E` (the “trigger symbol”), and otherwise consists of randomly chosen symbols from the set `{a, b, c, d}` except for two elements at positions `t1` and `t2` that are either `X` or `Y`.  \n",
    "For the `DifficultyLevel.HARD` case, the sequence length is randomly chosen between `100` and `110`, `t1` is randomly chosen between `10` and `20`, and `t2` is randomly chosen between `50` and `60`.  \n",
    "There are `4` sequence classes `Q`, `R`, `S`, and `U`, which depend on the temporal order of `X` and `Y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules are:\n",

    "```\n",
    "X, X -> Q,\n",
